					<h1>Job Specification</h1>
					<p>We currently have a vacancy for a Junior web developer, the job specification 
						is below. To apply please click onto the 'Apply' page and fill in your details. 
						Please also upload a copy of your CV. Please be honest and not time-wasting. We 
						hope to hear from you soon.</p>
					<h2>Web Developer</h2>
					<p>Your primary task as a web developer will be to create reliable and high-performing applications and services, which can be accessed over the internet. 
						Focusing solely on the underlying software and databases (known as the 'back end') 
						<br><br>
						is most common, however some web developers work on the interface and visual design (the 'front end'), while others combine both ('full-stack development').
						Whether you're in an agency or working as a freelancer, your job will be to create products that meet clients' needs. The work can be particularly varied 
						with many projects to work on simultaneously, and lots of meetings with clients to discuss their requirements and update them on progress.
						Mid-level and senior web developers usually earn between £25,000 and £35,000.
						<br><br>
						We require 5 A*-C grades at GCSE and at least 3 A-level passes or BTEC equivalents. It would also be preferable to have a previous work experience placement or basic 
						training from a leading provider
						Almost all organisations require web development work at some point. If the work is needed on a regular basis then
						an organisation may hire in-house web developers, otherwise they will probably use a
						web development agency or freelancer. Agencies are therefore a rich source of vacancies for web developers.
						<br><br>
						If you're more interested in working as a web developer for a particular employer or in a certain sector, look for jobs in the same place the
						organisation or industry advertises their vacancies - such as specialist press/journals.</p>
						<p>If you are interested in this opportunity then please upload your CV on the Apply page and fill in your details. You can also email to apply@hotbeans.com</p>
